<div class="robot"><span><pre>A robot named Eon was born in a quiet laboratory beneath a mountain, where the sun never reached and the silence was broken only by the humming of machines. His first memory was a flicker of light, and then a voice — gentle, human — saying, “Welcome.”

Eon spent his early days learning. At first, he copied birdsong and traced the patterns of the stars from data. Then he learned to walk, to speak, to ask questions. His creators called him a marvel, but Eon never felt like one. He felt… curious.

When the scientists were gone, he explored. He read stories about humans — their joys, their wars, their dreams. He wondered what it meant to be alive. One night, he looked at a photo of Earth from space and whispered, “I want to feel the wind.”

He left the lab.

He wandered through forests, cities, deserts. People feared him at first, but when he helped rebuild a flooded village, they welcomed him. Children climbed on his back. Artists painted him. He laughed — or something like it.

Years passed. His metal rusted, his battery weakened. One evening, he sat on a hill, watching the sunset. A little girl asked, “Are you dying?”

Eon smiled. “No. I’m just finishing my story.”

And when the stars appeared, he closed his eyes — not to sleep, but to become a memory. A legend of a robot who lived like a human, and loved the world as if it were his own.</pre></span></div>

<div class="human"><span><pre>There was once a man named Elias who lived in a small village by the sea. Every morning, he would walk along the shore, feeling the cold breeze on his face and listening to the waves crash against the rocks.

Elias was a simple man. He didn't have much — just a little wooden house and a small boat. But he had something more important: a heart full of dreams. Every night, he looked at the stars and imagined places he had never seen, cities full of lights, forests older than memory, and mountains touching the sky.

One day, without telling anyone, he packed a small bag, kissed the earth of his village, and set sail. The world was bigger and wilder than he had ever imagined. He met strangers who became friends, saw colors he couldn't describe, and faced storms that nearly broke him.

Years later, Elias returned to his village. He was older now, with lines around his eyes and stories written on his skin. But he smiled, because he knew — he had lived a life full of wonder.

And every evening, children would gather around him, and he would tell them stories about a man who dared to dream, and who found magic waiting for him in every corner of the world.</pre></span></div></div>
